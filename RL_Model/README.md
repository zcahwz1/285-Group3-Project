# DeepSeek-Reward PPO Model

This model leverages Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a policy gradient-based RL algorithm, to optimize AML detection strategies. We design a reward function based on
DeepSeek, which refines the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between regular and laundering transactions.

# Set up

The .ipynb notebook needs the following libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, networkx, torch, torch-geometric, gym, stable-baselines3, and tqdm.

# Usage

See the .ipynb notebook. It contains all code for data preprocessing, model training, and testing.
